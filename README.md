# BonziWORLD
This project is still W.I.P.

If you want to fork this, just try to put me somewhere in the credits.

## WARNING
Reading the source code in a illegal way and then achieving the godword will lead to the site being temporarily shutdown and then later gets its godmode changed. If you are just repeatedly doing it as a troll, I am PERMANENTLY deleting the entire source code, which also takes down BonziSPHERE. Please be nice with the source code.

## Dependencies
- Node.js and npm
- Ruby
- Sass
- Git
- Cordova (Optional)

## Setup
In a terminal/command prompt, navigate to where you'd like BonziSPHERE to be placed and run the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/27105/BonziSPHERE
cd BonziSPHERE
```

### Client
```
cd src
npm install
cd ..
```

### Server
```
cd server
npm install
node index.js

After this, BonziSPHERE will be accessible on port 3000. (http://localhost:3000/)

## Disclaimer
I'm not responsible if you screw up anything with your computer while setting this up. I have no idea how you would, but someone will find a way. I also will not provide support for installing dependencies. If you have everything installed properly, the above commands will work.
